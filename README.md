## 🌍 Overview

Traditional charity systems lack transparency.  
**TrustChain** uses a *simulated blockchain ledger* to record donations, making every transaction traceable and immutable.

Each donation becomes a **block** containing:
- Donor name
- Amount
- Purpose
- Timestamp
- Hash & previous hash linkage

Tampering breaks the chain, demonstrating **blockchain immutability**.
